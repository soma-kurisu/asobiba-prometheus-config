# up 
- is a special metric added by Prometheus when it performs a scrape
```C
up
```

# calculate 
- how many samples Prometheus is ingesting per second averaged over one minute
```C
rate(prometheus_tsdb_head_samples_appended_total[1m])
```

# graph 
- the memory usage of just the Node Exporters
- is the memory used by the Node Exporter process itself
```C
process_resident_memory_bytes{job="node"}

rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[1m])

rate(hello_worlds_total[1m])

rate(hello_world_exceptions_total[1m])
```

# calculate 
- the more useful ratio of exceptions
- gaps in the exception ratio graph for periods when there are no requests.
    - This is because we are dividing by zero, => NaN (Not a Number)
```C
rate(hello_world_exceptions_total[1m])
/
rate(hello_worlds_total[1m])
```

# Attempting to increase a counter by a negative number 
- is considered to be a programming error and will cause an exception to be raised.
```C
rate(hello_world_sales_euro_total[1m])
```

# will tell how many seconds it is since the last request was made.
```C
time() - hello_world_last_time_seconds
```

# return the per-second rate of Hello World requests
```C
rate(hello_world_latency_summary_seconds_count[1m])
```

# the amount of time spent responding to requests per second
```C
rate(hello_world_latency_summary_seconds_sum[1m])
```

# the average latency over the last minute
```C
rate(hello_world_latency_summary_seconds_sum[1m])
/
rate(hello_world_latency_summary_seconds_count[1m])
```

# histogram_quantile
- the `histogram_quantile` PromQL function can calculate a quantile from the buckets. For example, the 0.95 quantile (95th percentile) would be:
- the rate is needed as the bucketsâ€™ time series are counters.
```C
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(hello_world_latency_histogram_seconds_bucket[1m]))
```

# SLAS AND QUANTILES
- tools like Pyrra can assist in managing SLOs
- Latency SLAs often expressed as 95th percentile latency at most 500ms
- by having a 500ms bucket in histogram, can calculate ratio of requests that take over 500ms:
```C
hello_world_latency_histogram_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}
/ ignoring(le)
hello_world_latency_histogram_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"}
```

# latency vs quantiles
- it is recommended debugging latency issues primarily with averages rather than quantiles
- histogram also includes `_sum` and `_count` time series
```C
rate(hello_world_latency_histogram_seconds_sum[1m])
/
rate(hello_world_latency_histogram_seconds_count[1m])
```
